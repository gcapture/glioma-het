# Tumor heterogeneity and tumor-microglia interactions in primary and recurrent IDH1 mutant gliomas

Diffuse gliomas harbor recurrent mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene. IDH mutant gliomas are classified into two major subtypes: Oligodendrogliomas with chromosome arms 1p/19q codeletion and astrocytomas with euploid 1p/19q. Recent studies have highlighted intratumoral heterogeneity as a feature of IDH mutant gliomas. These tumors exhibit a hierarchy of cellular phenotypes, with a neural stem cell-like population giving rise to tumor subpopulations with expression signatures resembling astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, a detailed comparison of transcriptional and epigenomic heterogeneity in oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas is still lacking.

In addition, IDH mutant gliomas have distinct activation states of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs); however, it is not clear whether TAM composition differs between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, how tumor subpopulations interact with TAMs and to what extent tumor grade and recurrence play a role in promoting TAM diversity in diffuse gliomas. Therefore, comparative analyses of tumor heterogeneity and tumor-stroma interactions are critical to our understanding of IDH mutant gliomas and their evolution.

Here, we performed high-throughput single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing (snRNA- and snATAC-seq) on primary IDH mutant gliomas and snRNA-seq on a cohort of primary and recurrent astrocytoma pairs to create a resource to comprehensively resolve tumor diversity and TAM states. Our results confirm the previously described differentiation hierarchies and reveal a novel group of epigenetically and transcriptionally distinct ribosomal enriched non-cycling stem-like tumor cells in IDH mutant gliomas. We identify significant transcriptional differences in TAM states between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, and receptor-ligand interaction mapping between tumor subpopulations and TAM states reveals a notable interaction between inflammatory TAMs and astrocytic tumor subpopulations in astrocytomas confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses of validation cohorts. These results suggest that TAM-tumor interactions may contribute to the clinical course of oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas.
