# Figure S1 Legend {.unnumbered}

**Fig. S1** (**A** and **B**) UMAP representation and initial cluster assignment for merged snRNA-seq samples of oligodendroglioma (A) and astrocytoma (B). Colors represent assigned cell types. (**C** and **D**) Heatmap of CNA profiles inferred from snRNA-seq of oligodendrogliomas (**C**) and astrocytomas (**D**). Each row corresponds to a nucleus, ordered by initial cluster labeling from merged data. Red indicates gain and blue indicates loss. (**E** and **F**) Correlation heatmap depicting expression similarities (Pearson's correlation) between the highly variable genes of all tumor and TME clusters of oligodendrogliomas (**E**) and astrocytomas (**F**). (**G** and **H**) Box plots of the enrichment in RA markers per patient in oligodendroglioma (**G**) and astrocytoma (**H**).
