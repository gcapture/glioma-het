**Fig. S5. Robustness of RA metaprogram.** Correlation matrix depicting the Jaccard similarities between the NMF metaprograms and the Astrocyte-like, Oligo-like and Stemness programs in *Venteicher, et al.*. Three iterations of NMF have been computed, represented by the prefixes in the metaprograms name: OD\_ and AS\_ metaprograms belong to the first iteration, containing ribosomal genes. N\_ metaprograms correspond to the metaprograms retrieved prior removal of ribosomal genes. N2\_ metaprograms refer to the metaprograms retrieved prior removal of ribosomal genes and exclusion of sample *IDH_ACB_AD_540*, which has a significantly higher proportion of RA. OD_RA_Curated metaprogram contains the genes present in all three RA metaprogram iterations. Jaccard similarities depict a high consensus between all homologue iterations of NMF metaprograms.
